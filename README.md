# DSAIL Tech4Wildlife Workshop
This repository contains content to be delivered during the DSAIL Tech4Wildlife Workshop in collaboration with [Fauna \& Flora](https://www.fauna-flora.org/).  During this workshop we will demonstrate how AI can be used to aid conservation efforts. In particular we will build a camera trap capable of species identification at the Edge!
